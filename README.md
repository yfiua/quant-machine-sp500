## Backtest
Backtest is carried out from 2011.01 to 2023.02 (inclusive). Summary of the result:

* Annualized return: 20.60%
* Sharpe ratio: 1.06
* Sortino Ratio: 2.05
* Calmar Ratio: 1.05

Sharpe ratio and Sortino ratio are calculated with risk-free return 0 and geometric means (slightly more conservative than with arithmetic means).
